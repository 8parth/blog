title: Optimizing your queries with ActiveRecord
---

Last week gave a talk about "Querying with Rails" in a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AhmedabadRuby/events/242275060/) organized by the [Solute Technolabs LLP](http://solutelabs.com). Starting with basics of ActiveRecord, I focused on how Querying becomes difficult and complicated down the road with ever increasing features, and how to leverage ActiveRecord associations, joins, scopes and class methods.

Have a look at presentation:
