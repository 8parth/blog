DynamoDB is ideal when you need consistent high performance with large data effectively. Being NoSQL database, normalization isn't much benefical and hence associations and joins are not formed exactly how they are in SQL databases. In this article I explained how to form `has_many` Relationships with DynamoDB.  

[Modeling has_many Relationships with DynamoDB](https://blog.codeship.com/modeling-has_many-relationships-with-dynamodb/)

> Coming from a strong SQL background and being a fan of using ORM such as Active Record, adapting to the NoSQL mindset gave me an opportunity to rethink and explore the capabilities of NoSQL. But soon I realized that normalization is not always the right choice in the case of NoSQL databases. And more important, handling relations is a bit different.

Hope you find this useful, share your feedback.
